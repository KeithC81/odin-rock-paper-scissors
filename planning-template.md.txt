# **Algorithm Planning Template**



**Problem Statement:


(Describe the problem you are solving in a few sentences.)**




**Inputs:


(List the data the function will receive as input.)**





**Outputs:


(Describe what the function should return or display.)**






                                        **Steps to Solve:**


											**(Step 1 - Explain what needs to happen first)**


											**(Step 2 - Next logical step in the process)**


											**(Continue listing steps logically until the process is complete)**





**Edge Cases to Consider**



(List possible scenarios where the function may not behave as expected and how to handle them.)**:



**Potential Optimizations:



(Any ways to make the algorithm more efficient, if applicable.)**
