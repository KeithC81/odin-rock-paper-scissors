# **Algorithm Planning Template**



**Problem Statement:


(Describe the problem you are solving in a few sentences.)**
	 Meed a function that generates a random number for the computer which has the value 
	 assigned to them as  rock,  paper and scissors.
	 With another function that allows a user to pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
	

 Last, a function that takes the user and computer choices and displays the results to the screen.

	


**Inputs:


(List the data the function will receive as input.)**





**Outputs:


(Describe what the function should return or display.)**






               **Steps to Solve:**

								**(Step 1 - Explain what needs to happen first)**

									store a computer choice variable with a random number. 1 = rock 2 = paper, 3 = sciccors
											

												


								**(Step 2 - Next logical step in the process)**

									store a user choice variable with the same with rock = 1, paper = 2 and scissors as 3.




								**(Step 3)**

									Get results from comparing the user choice and computer choice




								**(step 4)**

									return the results to the display with you win or you lose


								**(Continue listing steps logically until the process is complete)**





**Edge Cases to Consider**



(List possible scenarios where the function may not behave as expected and how to handle them.)**:



**Potential Optimizations:



(Any ways to make the algorithm more efficient, if applicable.)**
